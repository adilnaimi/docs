Key network security components include:

1. **Network ACLs (Subnet Level):** These provide stateless filtering of network traffic at the subnet level. Rules are numbered and processed sequentially, with a default deny-all policy. Separate inbound and outbound rules offer fine-grained control, allowing only explicitly permitted traffic.
2. **Security Groups (Instance Level):** Acting as stateful firewalls, Security Groups track connections, allowing return traffic. Rules often reference other security groups for simplified management. They operate with a default deny-all inbound policy and a default allow-all outbound policy, utilizing only allow rules without explicit deny rules.
3. **Traffic Flow Control:**  The public subnet only accepts HTTPS traffic from the internet, protected by Cloudflare. The application tier only allows traffic from the load balancer, and the data tier is accessible only from the application tier, preventing direct internet access. Cross-AZ replication traffic is permitted within the data tier for high availability.
4. **Security Best Practices:**  The platform adheres to the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary network access. Traffic flow isolation between tiers minimizes the impact of potential breaches. Direct database access from the internet is prohibited, and a layered security approach combining NACLs and Security Groups is employed.

### Authentication and Authorization

User and service authentication are critical aspects of the platform's security.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant A as Auth Service
    participant B as Backend API
    participant D as Database

    U->>F: Login Request
    F->>A: Authenticate
    A->>D: Verify Credentials
    D-->>A: User Data

    alt Valid Credentials
        A->>A: Generate JWT
        A-->>F: Return JWT + Refresh Token
        F->>F: Store Tokens
        F-->>U: Login Success
    else Invalid Credentials
        A-->>F: Auth Error
        F-->>U: Login Failed
    end

    Note over U,F: Subsequent Requests
    U->>F: API Request
    F->>B: Request + JWT
    B->>B: Validate JWT

    alt Valid Token
        B->>D: Process Request
        D-->>B: Data
        B-->>F: Response
        F-->>U: Update UI
    else Expired Token
        B-->>F: Token Expired
        F->>A: Refresh Token
        A-->>F: New JWT
        F->>B: Retry Request
    end
```

*   **User Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token)-based authentication provides stateless and scalable user sessions. Integration with OAuth2 facilitates delegated authorization, and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security. Secure session management practices are implemented to protect user credentials.
*   **Service Authentication:** IAM roles for ECS tasks grant secure and granular permissions to AWS resources. AWS Secrets Manager securely stores and manages sensitive credentials. Service-to-service authentication mechanisms are used for internal components, and API key management is in place for external APIs and services.

### Data Protection

Data protection measures are implemented both at rest and in transit.

*   **Data at Rest:** RDS encryption using AWS KMS protects database data. S3 server-side encryption secures objects in S3 buckets. ElastiCache encryption protects data in Redis, and volume encryption is used for ECS tasks.
*   **Data in Transit:** TLS 1.3 is enforced for all external traffic. VPC endpoints are used for internal AWS service communication, and mTLS enhances security for service-to-service communication.

## Scalability Strategy

The RadPair platform is designed for horizontal scalability to handle increasing demands.

*   **Horizontal Scaling:** Auto-scaling groups manage compute resources, read replicas scale databases, caching layers can be scaled, and load balancers automatically adjust capacity.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Content delivery is optimized through CDNs, database queries are tuned for efficiency, caching strategies are employed, and resource utilization is continuously monitored.

## Reliability and High Availability

Reliability and high availability are ensured through redundant infrastructure and fault-tolerant mechanisms.

*   **Infrastructure Redundancy:** Multi-AZ deployments, redundant load balancers, database failover capabilities, and cache cluster redundancy minimize single points of failure.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Automatic failover mechanisms, circuit breakers, retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, and rate limiting contribute to the system's resilience.
*   **Monitoring & Recovery:** Health checks at all layers, automated recovery procedures, performance monitoring, and capacity planning ensure proactive issue detection and resolution.

## Compliance and Auditing

The platform is built with compliance and auditing requirements in mind.

*   **Audit Capabilities:** Comprehensive audit logging tracks access, changes, and resource modifications.
*   **Compliance Controls:** HIPAA compliance measures, GDPR readiness, SOC 2 compliance controls, and regular security assessments ensure adherence to regulatory standards.

## Disaster Recovery Plan

The platform has a well-defined disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity.

*   **Backup Strategy:** Automated and cross-region backups with point-in-time recovery capabilities are in place. Regular backup testing validates the recovery process.
*   **Recovery Procedures:** Defined Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO), documented recovery procedures, regular disaster recovery testing, and a comprehensive business continuity plan ensure the platform can recover from disruptive events.
